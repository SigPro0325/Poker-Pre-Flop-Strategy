# Poker-Pre-Flop-Strategy
# Advanced Poker AI Decision-Making Framework

This framework encapsulates an advanced decision-making process for a poker AI, integrating various strategies and mathematical models to guide actions in a poker game, specifically tailored for Texas Hold'em. The system evaluates hand strength, adapts to tournament stages, considers opponent profiles, and calculates expected values to inform actions such as folding, calling, and raising. This document delves into the complexities of the code, explaining the mechanisms and theories underpinning the AI's decision-making.

## Core Components and Theories

### Hand Strength Evaluation
- **Chen Formula Implementation**: Calculates an initial hand strength based on the Chen Formula, a popular method for evaluating Texas Hold'em starting hands.
- **Hand Group Classification**: Further classifies hands into strategic groups (e.g., suited connectors, blockers) to refine decision-making based on hand potential beyond the Chen Formula.

### Dynamic Aggression Adjustment
- Factors in tournament stage, player position, and round progression to adjust the AI's aggression level. Early stages and unfavorable positions prompt a more conservative approach, while later stages and advantageous positions warrant increased aggression.

### Betting Strategy
- **Adaptive Raising Strategy**: Calculates an optimal raise amount considering the hand's adjusted strength, stack-to-pot ratio (SPR), and the current betting situation. It dynamically adjusts the raise size based on tournament stage, opponent tendencies, and AI's table position.
- **Expected Value Calculation**: Uses a simplified model to calculate the expected value (EV) of a hand, guiding decisions to maximize long-term profitability.

### Bluffing Strategy
- Incorporates an advanced bluffing strategy that considers the AI's current table image, opponent profiles, position, and the tournament stage to decide on attempting a bluff. It aims to exploit opponent tendencies and situational advantages.

### Opponent Profiling and Adjustment
- Adjusts strategies based on perceived opponent tendencies (e.g., aggressive, passive) and adapts to the playing styles and strategies of opponents. This includes modifying aggression factors and decision thresholds based on opponent behavior.

### Positional and Situational Adjustments
- **Positional Play**: Adjusts play style based on the AI's position (early, middle, late, blinds), recognizing the importance of position in poker strategy.
- **Tournament Stage Consideration**: Alters strategies based on the progression of the tournament, emphasizing different tactics during early, middle, and final stages.

### Risk Tolerance and Stack Management
- Considers the AI's stack size relative to blinds and average stacks to adjust risk tolerance. Strategies vary from conservative (protecting a short stack) to aggressive (leveraging a large stack).

### Game Theory Optimal (GTO) and Exploitative Strategies
- Balances between GTO approaches, which aim for unexploitable play, and exploitative strategies that seek to take advantage of specific opponent weaknesses.

## Implementation Insights

- **Modular Design**: The code is structured to allow easy modification and extension of strategies, such as introducing new bluffing tactics or adjusting aggression levels.
- **Data-Driven Decision Making**: Utilizes a combination of hardcoded strategies and dynamic adjustments based on game state and opponent behavior, aiming to create a robust and adaptable AI.
- **Focus on Positional and Tournament Strategy**: Recognizes the significance of positional advantage and adapts to the changing dynamics of tournament play, including shifting strategies near the bubble and final table play.
- **Complexity in Simplicity**: While the underlying theories are complex, the implementation aims to maintain readability and efficiency, making strategic decisions based on a series of calculated factors and thresholds.

## Example Usage

The framework can be tested by simulating a poker game environment where the AI's hole cards, the stage of the tournament, opponent profiles, and other game state variables are defined. Running the `get_pre_flop_action` function with these inputs will demonstrate the AI's decision-making process in a pre-flop situation.

## Future Directions

- **Learning and Adaptation**: Integrating machine learning models to learn from game outcomes and opponent behaviors, allowing the AI to adapt its strategies over time.
- **Advanced Opponent Modeling**: Enhancing the profiling of opponents to consider more nuanced behaviors and patterns, potentially using historical data or real-time analysis.
- **Optimization and Performance**: Continuous refinement of the decision-making algorithms to improve performance, especially in complex scenarios with multiple decision factors.

This framework represents a sophisticated approach to AI decision-making in poker, blending classical poker strategies with advanced computational techniques to navigate the complexities of the game.
